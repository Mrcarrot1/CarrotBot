# CarrotBot 1.6 Roadmap
Tentative list of planned features for CarrotBot version 1.6. This list is subject to change.
* [ ] Reaction Roles
* [ ] Custom Role System (PARTIAL; NOT FULLY TESTED)
* [ ] Potential Modmail Improvements? (Use forums, more options, etc)
  * For the life of me I can't think of what "more options" was supposed to mean and I don't really want to mess with forums right now so probably not
* [X] Fix Conversation Persistence (for real this time)
* [X] Possibly migrate to a better encryption algorithm that improves security and allows us to make the whole bot open-source
* [X] Remove references to the now-removed Discord account discriminators
* Performance Improvements
  * [X] New DSharpPlus parallel event handlers
  * [ ] KON 1.2 if available
  * [X] Use StringBuilder instead of string where possible
  * [X] Cache some data instead of repeatedly retrieving it
  * [X] Make recovering from disconnects more efficient
