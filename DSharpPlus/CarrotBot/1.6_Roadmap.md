# CarrotBot 1.6 Roadmap
Tentative list of planned features for CarrotBot version 1.6. This list is subject to change.
* Reaction Roles
* Custom Role System
* Potential Modmail Improvements? (Use forums, more options, etc)
* Fix Conversation Persistence (for real this time)
* Possibly migrate to a better encryption algorithm that improves security and allows us to make the whole bot open-source
* Performance Improvements
  * New DSharpPlus parallel event handlers
  * KON 1.2 if available
  * Use StringBuilder instead of string where possible
  * Cache some data instead of repeatedly retrieving it
